# IMPORTANT: If you committed to the git repository before you added this .gitignore file
# you need to delete the excluded files manually from your git repository, to ensure, 
# that they are not tracked anymore. To delete them from git, just do the following:
# 
#     git rm --cached FILENAME
#
# ... Then everything should be fine.

# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control
#
# ignore them for now, add them if they become necessary

#     FROM ANSWER: Apple says "don't ignore it"
#     FROM COMMENTS: Apple is wrong; Apple code is too buggy to trust; there are no known negative side-effects to ignoring Apple's unofficial advice and instead doing the thing that actively fixes bugs in Xcode
# Up to you, but ... current advice: ignore it.
